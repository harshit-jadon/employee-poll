# About

This app is to create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes.
The user will be able to answer the question and upon answering will be able to see the polling results.

## The app will allow users to

### view polls
### answer poll questions
### see which polls havenâ€™t been answered yet
### see how other people have voted
### create their own poll questions
### see the ranking of users on a leader board

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`




## The _DATA.js file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

## There are two types of objects stored in our database:

### Users
### Questions
